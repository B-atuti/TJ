            <h1>Russian diplomacy</h1>
            <h3> Politics and Interest</h3>
            <p>According to classical realism, diplomacy is the means by which states
                defend their interests and achieve their objectives short of war, using a
                mixture of persuasion, compromise, and the threat of force. In the quartercentury since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian diplomacy has
                evolved from a passive, Western-orientation toward a muscular, multilateral
                and assertive posture. In the immediate post-perestroika years Russian
                diplomacy reflected the nascent democratic character of the new Russia, and
                the search for a new post-Soviet identity. Since Vladimir Putin ascended to
                the presidency, Russian diplomacy has become highly effective at several
                diplomatic issues. These include: Promoting and representing Russian
                national interests; defending key principles of sovereignty; non-interference
                in internal affairs; and respect for Russia as a great power; consolidating
                the former Soviet space as a privileged sphere of Russian influence; and
                addressing Russia's vital security concerns in the Eurasian region, including
                concerns with The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the
                European Union (EU) expansion eastward. </p>
